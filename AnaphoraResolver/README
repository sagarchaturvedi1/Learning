Refer instructions given in INSTALL file.

Tools -
1. Jsoup - To get news data from given URL
2. StanfordNLP - For coreference resolution

Major Classes -
1. AnaphoraResolverMain - It contains the main function.
2. NewsFetcher - Extracts news text from given Url.
3. CSVFileWriter - Writes the output to CSV file.

Approach -
1. Get the news title and text from given news Url.
2. Create StanfordCoreNLP pipeline that performs all operation like tokenization, sentence split and coreference resolution.

4. Get Coreference Chain Annotations from annotated document and make pairs of coreferences for each sentence number.
5. Store Sentence Number (Int), Coreference 1(String) and coreference 2 (String) in HashBasedTable of google guava library. This table structure is <Row,Column,Value>.
6. Combine Coreference pairs for each sentence and save them into csv with other details like Url, Serial NUmber etc.
